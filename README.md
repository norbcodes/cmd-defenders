<h1>CMD Defenders</h1>
<p>A tower defense games, made entirely out of ASCII characters, running in the CMD!</p>

<h2>The objective</h2>
<p>
  Simple! Place down towers of different types to destroy incoming waves of enemies.<br>
  There are various enemy types, each with their own speed, HP and weakness.<br>
  You also have different types of towers at your disposal, and each can target different weaknesses.<br>
  <br>That's it for the basics, there's a manual within the game that you can refer to at any time if you need help.<br>
</p>
<h2>Gamemodes and maps</h2>
<p>
  There are 20 maps you can choose.<br>
  You can also access the Map Editor (not yet) to create your own :D<br><br>
  On each map, you can select from 5 different gamemodes:<br>
  <ul>
    <li><b><i>Standard</b></i><br>Default gamemode.</li>
    <li><b><i>Hard</b></i><br>Enemies have 1.5x more HP and take 1 extra life when they get through.</li>
    <li><b><i>CMD Pro</b></i><br>Enemies have 2x more HP, move 2x faster and take 2 extra lives when they get through.</li>
    <li><b><i>Half Cash</b></i><br>After each wave and for each enemy kill, you recieve half of the cash.</li>
    <li><b><i>Reverse!</b></i><br>Enemies start at the end of track.</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>Note that at <i>Hard</i> and <i>CMD Pro</i> gamemodes, you will also recieve 1.5x and 2x more cash respectively.</blockquote>
