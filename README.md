  On each map, you can select from 6 different gamemodes:<br>

    <li><b><i>Hard</b></i><br>Enemies have 1.5x more HP and take 1 extra life when they get through.</li>
    <li><b><i>CMD Pro</b></i><br>Enemies have 2x more HP, move 2x faster and take 2 extra lives when they get through.</li>
    <li><b><i>Half Cash</b></i><br>After each wave and for each enemy kill, you recieve half of the cash.</li>
    <li><b><i>Reverse!</b></i><br>Enemies start at the end of track.</li>
    <li><b><i>Sandbox</b></i><br>Unlimited money and lives. You can also spawn enemies at will.</li>
