<h1>A smol library for recycling files</h1>

<p>
    This is a little utility I made that was inspired by the Python module "move2trash".<br>
    Yeah sure i'm copying them but like, not like i'm gonna distribute this, this is just for my own<br>
    convenience sake, hope you understand :)<br><br>
    So what does this do? Simple. It has a Recycle function which moves a file into the Recycle bin.<br>
    Thanks for reading, make sure to put Tools/recycle/src/ into your include path :)
