<h1>Hey there</h1>
<p>
    This is just for my convenience sake, and to make quick access if anyone wants to compile my game from ground up.
</p>

<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>If you're on anything other than Windows 10, winmm may be useless.</li>
    <li>Yes, I compiled Fluidsynth from source.</li>
    <li>Make sure to put the Fluidsynth DLL next to the game exe (mainly a note for Norb).</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Thank your for you patience.</i></p>

<p><b><i>- Norb, the dev</i></b></p>
